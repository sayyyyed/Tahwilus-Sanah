It is a java application with GUI and database that implements OOP principles. This application has a Solar, Hijri, and Saka year conversion feature. There is also a feature to calculate the solar year's age, determine pranoto mongso (rice planting time for Javanese people) and a feature to calculate weton. All features, except the age counter, have a +1 margin of error for not using the library.
